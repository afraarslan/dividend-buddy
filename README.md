# Dividend Buddy

It is a dividend tracking app. A user can search for a stock and add any amount of stock to his/her profile. 
In this way, he/she can see the annual, monthly, and daily dividend amount on the homepage.


### Pages

#### 1. Home page

It is a page for where dividends can be seen. It has two modals.

* Search Modal
* Edit Modal

#### 2. Settings page

This page contains the user profile, which is the username and the setting options. The theme stands for the setting option.
You can choose *dark mode* or *light mode* as you wish. (Dark is the default option.)
